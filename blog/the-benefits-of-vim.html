            If I was writing this a few months ago, it would be titled,
            "When to use VIM", as if it was not always worth using.
            This was before I realised I could use "VIM mode" in IDEs.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is now "The benefits of VIM", as I now always use VIM in some form
            when writing code. In IDEs, I can use
            <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim">IDEAVim</a>,
            a plugin which adds a "VIM Mode" to all IDEs made by
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Heck, I even use VIM
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">
              in the browser
            </a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I now have the powerful intelligence of IDEs, alongside the
            productivity-enhancing VIM.
          </p>

          <p>
            You didn't stick it out for long enough.
            VIM has a very steep learning curve, but once you learn it,
            and get a good .vimrc file to go with, it's great.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yeah, your productivity will take a hit when you initially start
            learning - but you have to stay with it.

            sure have a lot of IDEs... and all have a VIM-mode option.

          <p>
            I never have to use the mouse. Commands become ingrained into your
            muscle memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            I no longer have to lose focus on the logic of my algorithm to
            navigate through a menu to find some text-editing function.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's just in my head, in a command.
            If I don't know the command well enough such that I have to stop
            and think how to achieve something - then yes, I lose focus on the
            task. But if I have to do that function often enough, I will soon
            remember it and not have to lose focus.
