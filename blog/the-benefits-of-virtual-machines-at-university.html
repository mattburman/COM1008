            The ability to play.
            The ability to fail.
            The ability to host.
          </p>

          <p>
            Virtual machines allow students to learn all about operating systems.
            It would be great if we could just spin up a random Linux distro image,
            mess around with it, then destroy it as we please - all to learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            The VMs would all be sandboxed, of course. They would not be allowed
            access to other machines on the network. They would be allowed public
            internet access though.
          </p>

          <p>
            This would be free hosting for students - allowing us to host just
            because we can. Cost barriers put people off from tinkering.
          </p>

          <p>
            Curious students would come out of University with Unix/Sysadmin experience,
            all for free - requiring no modules in the topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sure - this would cost the University.
            I would personally argue it is a better investment than 12 NAO Robots,
            which are used irregularly, and haven't really taught me anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            What kind of a beast of a department cluster server could you buy for
            the price of 12 NAO Robots - probably over Â£80k?
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the very attractive things about Lancaster University was their
            virtual machines. I think it would look even more attractive at Sheffield.
